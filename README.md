# odin-recipes

Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

Thing I've learned:
- How use git add, git commit, and git push in an actual workflow
- How to add links to local images
- Remember to add links to enable users to go back to prior page
- List tags should wrap around the items
